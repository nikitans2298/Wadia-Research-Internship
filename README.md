## 📘 Overview

This research internship focused on the seismotectonic behavior of the **Delhi Fold Belt**, a structurally complex and seismically active region in northern India. The project involved cataloging earthquake events, generating ArcGIS-based maps of seismicity, and interpreting active tectonic lineaments and fault systems influencing regional earthquake activity.

The study was conducted using publicly available seismic event data from the [National Center for Seismology (NCS)](https://seismo.gov.in), under the research guidance of Wadia Institute scientist.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Collect earthquake event data (origin time, latitude, longitude, depth, magnitude) for the Delhi region from 2017 to 2020  
- Use ArcGIS to plot year-wise seismicity maps for visualizing spatial clustering  
- Review concepts of focal mechanism solutions to understand fault behavior in the region  
- Interpret seismotectonic patterns based on regional fault alignments and event concentrations

  ## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Developed competency in sourcing and analyzing earthquake data from public seismic catalogs  
- Applied GIS tools for spatial and temporal pattern mapping  
- Interpreted active seismotectonic zones by correlating clustered seismicity with mapped fault systems  
- **Justification**:  
  > Interpretation of active seismotectonic zones was based on the spatial and temporal clustering of seismic events (2017–2020) over known tectonic features. The alignment of epicenters with mapped geological structures reinforced the identification of currently active crustal zones in the Delhi Fold Belt.
